# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

Go ahead, create a tweet and post it! The live character counter helps users keep their tweets to a manageable size. If the counter isn't enough, animated messages alert the user when their tweets are too long, or too short. A responsive layout presents content across a range of devices. This app is a work in progress - more interactive features will be added in future updates!
